High-Level Design (HLD)

Objective: Briefly describe the main purpose and goals of the project or system.
Architecture Overview: Outline the primary components and the relationships between them (use block diagrams if applicable).
Key Modules: List major modules and their responsibilities.
Data Flow: Illustrate how data will travel between components.
Technology Stack: Specify technologies, frameworks, and tools.
Non-Functional Requirements: Include scalability, security, reliability, and performance considerations.

Low-Level Design (LLD)

Detailed Module Specifications: Describe each module with input, output, and processing logic.
Class Diagrams: Define the classes, their properties, methods, and relationships.
Database Schema: Present tables, fields, relationships, and indexing strategies.
APIs/Interfaces: List APIs with endpoints, request/response formats, and error handling.
Error Handling & Logging: Specify error handling and logging for debugging.
Pseudo Code/Flowcharts: Provide code-like structures for complex algorithms or flows.
